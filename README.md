# Data-Structures implementation using python

    --> A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that the data can be used efficiently.
    --> Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.
    --> For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited for implementation of databases, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers
    --> The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks

# TYPES:
#### LINEAR
    --> Elements form a sequence or a linear list.
    --> Examples: Array. Linked List, Stacks and Queues
#### NON-LINEAR
    --> Traversal of nodes is nonlinear in nature.
    --> Example: Graph and Trees.
